# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming: The Book Class
# ====================================================
#
# In this exercise, you'll create a Book class that represents a book in a library.
# Follow the instructions in the TODO comments to complete the implementation.
#
# Learning Objectives:
# 1. Understand how to create a class
# 2. Learn about class attributes and methods
# 3. Practice using the __init__ constructor
# 4. Implement instance methods
# 5. Create string representation of objects
